// const me = {
//     name: "Tim",
//     age: 27,
//     email: "timothykwok95@gmail.com"

// me.age = 1000;

// const monster = {
//     name: "Slimer",
//     color: "greenish",
//     type: "plasm or ghost or something"
//  }

//  What would you write to access the name and console.log it?
// monster.name = "Gale"
// console.log(monster.name)
//  What would you write to change the type to 'creature' (without changing it inside the object itself)
// monster.type = "creature"
//  What would you write to add a key to the object called age, and set the age to 6?
// monster.age = 6;
//  console.log the object to make sure type is creature, and age is 6
// console.log(monster)



// Let's say you want to make an adventure game where you are an adventurer and you are going to fight ogres.

// Using objects, create models and have them interact.

//     how would you model your adventurer? Your adventurer will want a name and hitpoints. What else would your adventurer need?

//     how would you model an ogre? Your ogre will want hitpoints.

//     Write a very small program that will simulate a battle between your adventurer and an ogre.
//         When your adventurer's hitpoints reach 0 the game is over.
//         When your ogre's hitpoints reach 0 the game is over.

//     Bonus: Try to accept user input for the game by running it in the Chrome console and using alerts and prompts
